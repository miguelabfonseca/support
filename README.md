## About this Demo Laravel CRM APP with multi tenant user

My Demo Laravel CRM APP pretends to be a demo web CRM application with demo capabilities of what I can do and what my CRM APP can be. I believe that with this APP you can assess my development capabilities in Laravel. Although I have many years in PHP I only work with Laravel for about 2 years. I'm open to your opinions and feedback about my development technics. 

At this time this only has only a fraction of the tenant setup working and the tenant registration working. This is the version 0.1

This APP has a template from Envato Elements that is not registered for comercial purposes (isn't completely included in this APP).

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).
